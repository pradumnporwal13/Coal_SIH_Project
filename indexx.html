            <h4><b>Smart India Hackathon 1313 : </b> <u>A system of IoT Devices to prevent under-loading / overloading of Railway wagons.</u></h4>
            <br>
            <h4><b>Description : </b>CIL has been supplying coal to its consumers by Rail through Railway Sidings. The railway wagons at such sidings are loaded through contractual means by payloader. The loading of wagons by contractual arrangement often results in overloading or underloading Railway wagons. The rules of Penal overloading and underloading are notified by Railway. Any penalty for overloading charged by the Railway for any consignment is payable by the purchaser. However, in case of underloading of wagons, credit for idle freight is adjusted in coal bills. Thus any idle freight for under-loading is borne by CIL. During 2021-22, the expense for under-loading was nearly Rs.593 Cr. whereas the contract for wagon loading itself was only Rs.276 Cr. Hence, a digital solution in the form of sensor/ IoT is needed to prevent the under-loading and overloading of Railway wagons.</h4>
            <br>
            <h4><b>Our Solution :</b> We have developed an IoT-based system to address the challenges associated with the overloading and underloading of coal wagons. Our solution consists of an IOT setup that accurately weighs the coal loaded inside the wagon, providing real-time data of the weight(in Kgs) carried by each wagon on our website (While loading of Wagons). Additionally, it can detect temperature and humidity levels within the coal.</h4>
            
            
            <br><br>
            <h4>On our website, real-time loading data for each wagon will be displayed in a tabular form. Each row is dedicated to a specific wagon, and the table columns include Wagon Number, Weight, Overloading/Underloading Status, Temperature, and Humidity.

                As each wagon gets loaded, its data is updated in the table in real-time. This enables operators and concerned authorities to monitor the loading status of each wagon individually.
                
                Once all the wagons are loaded, we will store this data in an Excel sheet for reference and historical records.
                
                Upon the train's arrival at its destination, a final weight check will be conducted to ensure that there has been no theft or tampering during transit. Any discrepancies will be promptly identified and investigated."
                
                This comprehensive approach ensures not only real-time monitoring of loading but also accountability and security checks during transportation.</h4>

                <h4>Each wagon is equipped with 8 wheels, arranged in 4 pairs. Our plan is to install load sensors along the railway track, ensuring a consistent spacing between each sensor that mirrors the distance between each pair of wheels on the wagon. Therefore, a minimum of 4 load sensors per wagon is necessary, but eight sensors are preferred to achieve the most accurate measurements. <br> <img src="8sensorsArrangedOnTrack.jpg" alt="" height="350px"></h4>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="diplayFlexContainer" >
                <h4>When all the wagons are positioned on the railway track, and the showel/payloader operator begins loading coal into the wagons, real-time data will be displayed on the website for the concerned authorities at CIL. Additionally, an external device will issue alerts to the showel/payloader operator, indicating whether the coal is being loaded correctly, if there is overloading, or if there is underloading. This dual monitoring system ensures both online reporting to authorities and immediate feedback to the equipment operator, enhancing the loading process's efficiency and accuracy. <br> <br> Then, when the train is fully loaded, we will retrieve the weight data and store it in an Excel sheet (available for download on our website). Afterward, we will reset all load measurements and commence recording data for the next train.</h4>

                <img src="UnevenWeight.jpg" alt="" height="150px">
                <h4>Uneven weight distribution within a wagon is a significant factor that can contribute to derailments. The primary reason behind this risk is that excessive weight on one side causes greater wear and tear on the wheels of that side, increasing the likelihood of a derailment. Additionally, loading wagons with an imbalanced weight distribution can have adverse effects on the condition of the tracks, posing a potential threat to overall railway safety and infrastructure integrity. <br><br> To overcome this obstacle, the showel operator must ensure a uniform and even distribution of coal while loading the wagon.</h4>
            </div>
            <br>
            <h4><b>Iot Setup for Showel operator</b></h4>
            <h4>We have also developed an IoT setup that visually communicates the loading status, both overloading and underloading, directly to the shovel operator. It functions like a <i>traffic light system</i> , where the operator responsible for loading coal can visually determine whether to continue loading ('Green🟢' indicating 'proceed'), pause loading ('🟡Yellow' indicating 'halt'), or stop loading ('🔴Red' indicating 'overloading in progress'). This system provides real-time feedback on the loading process, enhancing efficiency and safety.</h4>
            <br>
            <h4 style="color: grey;"> <i> In short, we made an IOT based System that detects the temperature, humidity of the consignment also checks overloading & underloading status of the wagon showing it in a dedicated website and providing the information of the consignment to all the stakeholders </i></h4>
